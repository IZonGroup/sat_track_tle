##TLE data for the two satellites is loaded from files on disk using the load.tle() function. The current date and time are set, and the positions of the satellites at that time are calculated using the satellite.at() method. The distance between the two satellites is then calculated, and if the distance is less than 10 km, we conclude that the satellites are on a collision course

# Import the Skyfield library and the built-in time module
import skyfield
from skyfield.api import load, EarthSatellite
from skyfield.timelib import Time
import time

# Load the TLE data for the two satellites
lines = open('satellite1.tle', 'r').readlines()
sat1 = EarthSatellite(*lines)
lines = open('satellite2.tle', 'r').readlines()
sat2 = EarthSatellite(*lines)

# Set the current date and time
ts = load.timescale()
t = ts.utc(2020, 12, 11, 14, 0, 0)

# Compute the positions of the satellites at the current time
sat1_xyz = sat1.at(t).position.km
sat2_xyz = sat2.at(t).position.km

# Calculate the distance between the two satellites
distance = ((sat1_xyz[0] - sat2_xyz[0])**2 +
            (sat1_xyz[1] - sat2_xyz[1])**2 +
            (sat1_xyz[2] - sat2_xyz[2])**2)**0.5

# Determine whether the satellites are on a collision course
if distance < 10:
    print('The satellites are on a collision course!')
else:
    print('The satellites are not on a collision course.')
